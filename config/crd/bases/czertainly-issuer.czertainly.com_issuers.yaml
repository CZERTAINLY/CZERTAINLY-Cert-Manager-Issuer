                  AuthSecretName is a reference to a kubernetes.io/tls Secret that is
                  used to authenticate and authorize to CZERTAINLY platform.
                  The Secret must be in the same namespace
                  as the referent. If the referent is a ClusterIssuer, the reference instead
                  refers to the resource with the given name in the configured
                  'cluster resource namespace', which is set as a flag on the controller

                  The Secret must be in the same namespace as the referent and must
                  contain 'ca.crt' in data. If the referent is a ClusterIssuer, the reference instead
                  refers to the resource with the given name in the configured
