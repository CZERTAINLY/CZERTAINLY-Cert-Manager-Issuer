# CZERTAINLY-Cert-Manager-Issuer


## Generated CZERTAINLY OpenAPI client

The CZERTANILY client is generated from OpenAPI specification [`doc-openapi-cert-manager.yaml`](doc-openapi-cert-manager.yaml) using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) and modified to work properly with the issuer implementation. All the changes are patched using the [openapi.patch](openapi.patch) file.

To regenerate and apply changes to the client, run the following command:

```bash
make openapi-generate
```

To clean the generated client, run the following command:

```bash
make openapi-clean
```
